    "\"This model predicts the probability of each shot being a goal. Factors such as the distance from the net, angle of the shot, type of shot, and what happened before the shot are key factors in the model. This model was built on over 50,000 goals and 800,000 shots in NHL regular season and playoff games from the 2007-2008 to 2014-2015 season with location data. By adding up all the probabilities of a team's shots during a game, we can calculate the team's expected goals in that game. The model was built using gradient boosting. MoneyPuck's expected goals model uses a different variable strategy than other expected goals like from Corsica Hockey or HockeyGraphs.com. The MoneyPuck expected goals model does not explicitly use variables for rebounds or rush shots. Rather, it looks at the 'speed' between events: The distance on the ice between the shot and the event before it divided by the amount of time that's elapsed. Also, for rebound shots the model looks at the change in angle between the shots divided by the amount of time between the two shots. The illustrations below describe how the speed variables are created.\""

Jared McCann is also in that list, and personally I would not include him as a superstar so it is interesting that he scored 22 goals more than expected. We did not gain much new information from this analysis, other than potentially making predictions about the outlier players (such as McCann). This does involve prior knowledge about these players.\n",
